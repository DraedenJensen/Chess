**Date:** 

The program was started on June 15, 2023, and completed on October 15, 2023.
The model was worked on throughout June 2023. The GUI was worked on throughout October 2023.

## Description

This solution contains a Windows Forms chess app. Running the program starts a GUI from which the user can play multiplayer games
on a single system or single-player games against a computer.

## Credits

All code for the game logic and GUI was written by me (Draeden Jensen). Open online sources were used for images, and the
Stockfish chess engine was used for the single-player AI.

This was my first time developing with Windows Forms so naturally I consulted a whole lot of official Microsoft documentation:

I used Wikipedia just to refresh myself on how chess notation works:

And this very useful Stack Exchange post helped me get started with using a C# process to run Stockfish inside my app:
